                    <h2>Welcome to Department of Delhi Transport Corporation</h2>
                    <p>Government of India, Ministry of Transport took over the local bus services of Delhi in May 1948
                        in
                        the name of Delhi Transport Service when they found that the services offered by Gwalior and
                        Northern India Transport Company Ltd., the then licensee, were inadequate. A Delhi Road
                        Transport
                        Authority was constituted under the Road Transport Corporation Act, 1950. This Authority became
                        an
                        undertaking of Municipal Corporation of Delhi by an Act of Parliament in April 1958. On the
                        recommendation of a Working Group of Planning Commission which concluded that Delhi Transport as
                        an
                        extension of Municipal Corporation of Delhi had not been functioning efficiently and adequately
                        resulting in leakage of revenue and very high operation cost, Govt. of India took over the
                        management of the undertaking by passing the Delhi Road Transport Laws (Amendment) Act, in 1971.
                        It
                        took over the assets and liabilities from the erstwhile Delhi Transport Undertaking (DTU)
                        operated
                        by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi till 2nd Nov, 1971. Thus the DTC was set up in 1971. DTC
                        which
                        was functioning under the administrative control of Govt. of India, was finally taken over by
                        Govt.
                        of NCT, Delhi on 05.08.1996.</p>
